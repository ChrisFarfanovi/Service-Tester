# Service-Tester

A simple script to practice my Python skills

## Old Script

The old script is less than ideal and I'll be remaking it shortly, mostly focusing on documentation to make it all more understandable.

*NOTE:* The HTTP function of the old script was never finished, but will be sorted with the new one.

## New Script

This script is much simpler. Instead of using global scopes I've tried to make sure I pass information from function to function.

I've also implemented dynamic imports so I can write new modules without breaking old ones. This would theoretically allow me to built a menu of possible services to test, but that's probably for a later time.
